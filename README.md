# FEWD Week #8: Forms

---

### Description

This week, you'll be practicing your form skills: you have the option of adding a form to your final project, or finishing the Relaxr form that will be started in class. The form you build must include at least three different types of HTML form elements and some light CSS styling. We have given you an example of a form that renders well on the web and mobile devices, as well as an example, with starter code, of a registration form you could build for Relaxr.

### Real-World Applications

- Be able to apply the proper HTML and CSS styles to create a modern web form
- Revisit applications and projects to iterate on code you've written

<br>

---

### Technical Requirements

- Use at least three different types of HTML5 form elements: `input`, `textarea`, `select`, `radio` `button`, `dropdown`, `checkbox`
- Link to your sign-up page from different pages in your application
- Style forms lightly using CSS
- Make sure a user's password is not visible when they are entering it

#### Bonus

- Use responsive media queries to allow for proper rendering on mobile devices
- To replicate application flow, add another page that says "Thanks for Relaxing with us!" after submission
